Rising housing values in Dallas put financial pressure on homeowners and also affect renters. This increases the cost of living in a city that continues to grow in both population and housing demand. To help balance property valuation practices, it is important that homeowners have access to tools that allow them to protest their appraised values. Doing so promotes fairness, helps regulate the market, and makes homeownership more sustainable in the long term.

My project will create a Python interface to help Dallas County homeowners prepare equal and uniformed (is a legal standard in Texas property tax law that ensures similar properties are appraised at similar values) protests. By entering a Property ID, the program will retrieve parcel data downloaded or scraped from Dallas County's public appraisal databases. This will be show details such as location, market value, state code, neighborhood, etc . It will then automatically identify comparable properties with similar characteristics that can help the house owner have accurate evidence during the protest process.

I will use pandas for data handling and analysis of the datasets, and scarping code to get specific information form the Dallas County website. The idea is to generate information for report that includes summary tables, graphs, and statistics to support the protest. I also want to use GIS libraries/packages to create a map that visualizes spatial relationships between the subject property and its comparable properties. My limitations at the moment are, lack of knowledge on GIS packages, and find what is the best most efficient way to restive the data form https://www.dallascad.org/ .
